### Description:
---

This is version 2.0 of an earlier [Project](https://github.com/trrapp12/hang_man).  It evolved from the "hang_man" also listed in my GitHub account.  We simply took it and made it more object-oriented.

<br/>
<br/>
### Original project demonstrated the following:
---

- [x] Correct use of functions, conditionals, loops, arrays.
- [x] Properly sequence Python statements.
- [x] Select a random word from a dictionary of words.
- [x] Display all guesses on the user's screen so the user knows what letters he/she has already guessed.
- [x] Display a visual indication for each letter in the word.
- [x] Display the number of turns remaining.
- [x] Decrement the number of turns remaining.
- [x] Display letters guessed in the position that they are contained in the word.

<br/>
<br/>
### This project adds additional use of:
---

- [x] Object Oriented Programming techniques.
- [x] Classes and Inheritance.
