### Description:
---

This is version 2.0 of an earlier [Project](https://github.com/trrapp12/hang_man).  It evolved from the "hang_man" also listed in my GitHub account.  We simply took it and made it more object-oriented.

<br/>
<br/>

### Instructions on how to launch:
---

1. Make sure you have a Python interpreter installed: 
  - on a Mac type &#8984;  + `space`
  - type "terminal"
  - press `Enter`
  - in the shell command line type 
 
 ```
 \\Check the system Python version
$ python --version

\\Check the Python 2 version
$ python2 --version

\\Check the Python 3 version
$ python3 --version

```

2. This will show you if you have Python installed already and which version you have installed. 
 
3. If you need to, install Python
  - From your browser navigate to Python.org
  - On the Python.org page, find the links to download the file.  Versions are available for Mac or Windows.  However, I found the Mac version worked more consistently for me.

  <br/>
  <br/>

4. Create a Folder to hold the program
  - in the terminal type `mkdir Hangman` or whatever other name you want to call it. 
  - navigate into the folder by typing `cd Hangman`
  - clone the program into the Hangman folder you just created by typing: 
 
 ```
 https://github.com/trrapp12/object_oriented_hangman.git
 ```
  
5. Make sure you are still in the Hangman folder
6. You should be able to see a program named 'hangman.py'.  If not, navigate back into the Hangman folder.  
7. Type `python hangman.py` to run the program from the terminal
8. The program runs from prompts in the Command Line, so watch for prompts and respond accordingly. 
9. Enjoy!

### Original project demonstrated the following:
---

- [x] Correct use of functions, conditionals, loops, arrays.
- [x] Properly sequence Python statements.
- [x] Select a random word from a dictionary of words.
- [x] Display all guesses on the user's screen so the user knows what letters he/she has already guessed.
- [x] Display a visual indication for each letter in the word.
- [x] Display the number of turns remaining.
- [x] Decrement the number of turns remaining.
- [x] Display letters guessed in the position that they are contained in the word.

<br/>
<br/>

### This project adds additional use of:
---

- [x] Object Oriented Programming techniques.
- [x] Classes and Inheritance.
